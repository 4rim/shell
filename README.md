# Teaching myself bash scripting

## Notes for myself

- Knowing a scripting language is useful (and I still haven't gotten around
to properly learning python yet...)
- Bash/shell scripting in general is useful for the field of CS I'm interested
in (systems, cybersecurity, networks)
- I want to add interesting scripts to my Linux workstation (as of now I'm
doing most of this on my MacBook, and its default shell is zsh)
- I'm interested in branching out to BSD and other \*NIX likes
- I want to be a more efficient programmer

## Plan

- This is not going to be super comprehensive as I just want to learn enough to
get up and running
- Starting today (Apr 25) I am going through MIT Csail's [https://missing.csail.mit.edu/](Missing Semester)
and hope to be finished a week or so from now (May 2)
- I want to write 2-3 bash scripts per week, preferably more if I can, either for use on my MacBook or my ThinkPad (which runs Linux)
- All the scripts I write, even the most rudimentary/pointless, will be uploaded here, as well as links to
other helpful resources, and example scripts I've found online (with credits of course)

## Set-up

_Kind of irrelevant, mainly for me to look back on_

- *Text editor*: neovim with a handful of plugins, mainly:
    - coc for autocomplete
    - shellcheck for static code checking
    - vim-airline 
    - vim fugitive for VCS
- You can find my config file [https://github.com/4rim/dotfiles](here) if you're
curious
