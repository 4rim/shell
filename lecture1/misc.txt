Misc notes:

source <.sh file>

or 

. <.sh file>

lets you *run the script in the current shell*. 

normally, just executing a shell script actually uses fork() under the hood to
create a new clone of itself (called a child process). this is nice but it
doesn't let us change our current directory, for example, which is what the
marco/polo question asks us to do.
