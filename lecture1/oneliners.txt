One-line commands, not full-blown scripts.
For the lectures "shell tools"

1.
ls -ahclt --color=auto

-a = list all files, even if they're hidden
-h = human readable
-clt = "c" with "lt", sort by and show ctime (time of last modification with
file status info) --color=status = status can be "never", "auto", or "always".
"auto" and "always" both enables color, but "auto" only enables color if the
output is to a terminal.

2.
find . -name "*.html" -type f | xargs tar -czvf archive.tar

find is already recursive. you can define a depth using --max-depth and
--min-depth though.

-c = create or compress, not sure what it stands for. (its inverse is -x,
meaning extract)
-z = use the gzip compression algo
-v = verbose (print out the files that are being compressed)
-f = specify filename of archive (in this case archive.tar)

xargs = takes items from STDIN and then executes whatever command is placed
after it (default is echo). in this way, we can operate on anything streamed
into xargs via pipe.

but because xargs uses whitespace (newlines and spaces) as a delimiter, files
with whitespace in their names will not be correctly parsed. we can bypass this
issue with the flag -print0 if our xargs input is an output of find.
